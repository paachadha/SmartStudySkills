       <p> Hi to all. My name is Patrick. I am a graduate in business but have decided to transition into the tech industry. I have completed courses in computer networking but also decided to familiarize myself in both web and graphic design. I am looking to utilize the design skills to implement towards a possible business plan. New to the tech side of things, I am hoping to continue learning about the industry and gaining key skills to advance. </p>
