          <h3>Retrieval Practice</h3>
          <p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice
tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each
other.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="skill">
          <h3>Spaced Practice</h3>
         
           <p>This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to
form lasting memories.</p>
          
          </div>
          
          <div class="skill">
          <h3>Elaboration</h3>
          
          <p>Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your
own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>
          
          </div>
          
          <div class="skill">
          <h3>Interleaving</h3>
          
          <p>Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things
up with Interleaving.</p>
          
          </div>
          
          
          <div class="skill">
          <h3>Concrete examples</h3>
          
          <p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already
know. Learning and creating specific exampl
es of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
          
          </div>
          
          
          
          <div class="skill"><h3>Dual Coding</h3>
          <p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain
more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
